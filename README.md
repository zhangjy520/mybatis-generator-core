## Usage

replace  origin mybatis-generator-core 1.3.6 in your local repository with this.

Then regenerated using maven plugin 1.3.6

It will not override the existing content,only add the content you delete.

If your mybatis-generator-version is not v1.3.6,download source code,change version in pom.xml and install on your local repository.

If you mybatis-generator-version is too old to be compatible with v1.3.6,suggestion is switch to new version,or you can change old version's source code.

I have mark "todo" on what I modified in source code, if you open it in idea,this can give you a little help  if you want to modify source code.
